# Unoffical skDragon for MC 1.17 - 1.18
This is a quick and dirty version of skDragon with the only goal of running well enough on 1.17 - 1.18.
As of writing this, the official repo is missing the majority of the code, so this is
based on a decompiled version of the skDragon 0.17 JAR. When the original author releases
a version for 1.17 - 1.18, I **STRONGLY** encourage you to use that instead, but for the time being,
this should cover your needs. Please note that this does not support the red tint effect you
can apply to players (I couldn't bother fixing it for 1.17 - 1.18 and don't use it personally, so I nuked it).
If you find any issues with it, feel free to post them, but I can't guarantee I'll fix them.
***All credit for skDragon goes to Sashie, you can find the official repo
[here](https://github.com/Sashie/skDragon) and the official downloads
[here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skript-addon-skdragon-free-emotes-particles-great-eula-perks.24173/).***

There are releases available here, but you can try and compile it yourself if you want.
If you have issues resolving dependencies, you can put them in a directory called "libs", at the root of the project instead.
