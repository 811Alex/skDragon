# Unoffical skDragon for MC1.17
This is a quick and dirty version of skDragon with the only goal of running well enough on 1.17.
As of writing this, the official repo is missing the majority of the code, so this is
based on a decompiled version of the skDragon 0.17 JAR. When the original author releases
a version for 1.17, I **STRONGLY** encourage you to use that instead, but for the time being,
this should cover your needs. Please note that this does not support the red tint effect you
can apply to players (I couldn't bother fixing it for 1.17 and don't use it personally, so I nuked it).
If you find any issues with it, feel free to post them, but I can't guarantee I'll fix them.
